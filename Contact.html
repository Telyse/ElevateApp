    <h2 class="lato-regular">About Me</h2>
    <p class="lato-regular">I wanted to build an application that helps others improve their overall health by reducing risk of chronic
      diseases, maintaining a healthy weight, boosting their mood, increase energy levels, and promoting better sleep. What better way to do that than creating
      a fitness application. The main focus of my application is for users to set goals, track progress, receive beneficial health tips, and stay motivated.
      I would love for my application to help users stay motivated and consistent with their workout routines and diet. Consistently meeting one's goals can
      boost self esteem and sense of accomplishment, improving overall health. In doing this, helping others elevate their lives brings me to a state
      accomplishment, because I believe that Iâ€™m helping create a more happy, positive, and confident society!</p>
