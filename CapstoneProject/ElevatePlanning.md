software engineer project manager

//Definition statement:
I want to build an application that helps others improve their overall health by reducing
risk of chronic diseases, maintaining a healthy weight, boosting their mood, increasing energy
levels, and promoting better sleep. What better way to do that than creating a fitness application.
The main focus of my application is for users to set goals, track progress, receive beneficial
health tips, and stay motivated. I would love for my application to help users stay motivated and
consistent with their workout routines and diet. Consistently meeting one's goals can boost self
esteem and sense of accomplishment, improving overall health. In doing this, helping others elevate
their lives brings me to a state accomplishment, because I believe that Iâ€™m helping create a more
happy, positive, and confident society!

// What does it solve?
The main problem I would like my application to solve is helping users with fixed/busy schedules find
time to "Elevate" themselves by improving their overall health. Finding time do this can be hard if
users have no time to focus on themselves.
