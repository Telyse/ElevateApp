Telyse

Name: Elevate

//Definition statement:
I want to build an application that helps others improve their overall health by reducing
risk of chronic diseases, maintaining a healthy weight, boosting their mood, increasing energy
levels, and promoting better sleep. What better way to do that than creating a fitness application.
The main focus of my application is for users to set goals, track progress, receive beneficial
health tips, and stay motivated. I would love for my application to help users stay motivated and
consistent with their workout routines and diet. Consistently meeting one's goals can boost self
esteem and sense of accomplishment, improving overall health. In doing this, helping others elevate
their lives brings me to a state accomplishment, because I believe that Iâ€™m helping create a more
happy, positive, and confident society!

// What does it solve?
The main problem I would like my application to solve is helping users with fixed/busy schedules find
time to "Elevate" themselves by improving their overall health. Finding time do this can be hard if
users have no time to focus on themselves.

//Target Audience:
My target audience is everyone. Anyone of different backgrounds, genders, age, whatever you name it.
For  beginners who are new to fitness and want to get started, Individuals with busy schedules
who want flexible workouts & simple but healthy meals,  fitness enthusiasts who are already active
and want to improve their fitness, etc.

// Navigation:
I want to use a tabs navigation with combining flat/lateral & hierarchial structures. My vision
for the app is to see each page in the tabs, once clicking the which ever page, you see all
content related to each page. I think combining both structures will help create the vision I have
for the application, using the navigation above. I would also like to use a search navigation for
the nutrition/food page. I would like to have a feature that lets users search macronutrients,
calories, etc.

// Functions on each page:
1. The dashboard or home page, which the main functions wil be a form and hoover-click function. For
now that's all that I've planned to use for the first page, I will probably use more once the
application is being actively created.

2. The workout page functions will be a hoover-click, deleting & adding workout functions, timer, and
a save progress function (I don't know if there is an actual name for a "save progress" function,
so I will name it as stated above). This will the main functions for the second page.

3. The nutrition page functions will have a search bar, hoover-click, and save function. These
will be the first few functions used on the third page. I would like the search bar and save
to be the focal points for this page. I might also add a function that lets users add and save recipes
(This isn't for certain but definitely a idea for the future).

4. The About Me/contact page will have a hoover-click and form function. The form will be used for users
to give me their concerns and/ or feedback. This will be the the first thing you notice about the
4th and final page of this application.

// Font:
The font will be Lato

// Logo:
The logo will be a heart with a pulse inside of it. Below are links to see examples!
