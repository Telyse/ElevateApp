        I wanted to build an application that helps others improve their overall
        health by reducing risk of chronic diseases, maintaining a healthy
        weight, boosting their mood, increase energy levels, and promoting
        better sleep. What better way to do that than creating a fitness
        application. The main focus of my application is for users to set goals,
        track progress, receive beneficial health tips, and stay motivated. I
        would love for my application to help users stay motivated and
        consistent with their workout routines and diet. Consistently meeting
        one's goals can boost self esteem and sense of accomplishment, improving
        overall health. In doing this, helping others elevate their lives brings
        me to a state accomplishment, because I believe that Iâ€™m helping create
        a more happy, positive, and confident society!
